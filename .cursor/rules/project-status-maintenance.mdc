# Project Status Maintenance

## Core Requirement

**Every active project repository MUST maintain a `PROJECT_STATUS.md` file at the root level.**

This file serves as a living document that tracks the current state of the project, completed work, and next steps.

## File Location

- **Path**: `PROJECT_STATUS.md` (repository root)
- **Format**: Markdown
- **Required**: Yes, for all active development projects

## Update Frequency

**The PROJECT_STATUS.md file MUST be updated on every iteration** when:
- New features are implemented
- Bugs are fixed
- Tests are added or updated
- Dependencies are changed
- Documentation is modified
- Project structure changes
- Any significant work is completed

## File Structure Template

The PROJECT_STATUS.md should include (at minimum):

```markdown
# [Project Name] - Project Status

**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Overall Status**: [Status Emoji] **[Percentage]% Complete** - [Brief Status]

---

## Executive Summary

| Component | Status | Progress | Blocking |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Component 1 | ✅ Complete | 100% | - |
| Component 2 | 🟡 In Progress | 50% | - |
| Component 3 | ⚠️ Pending | 0% | No |

**Current Readiness**: [Status] - [Brief description]

---

## ✅ Completed Components

[List of completed work with dates and details]

---

## 🚧 In Progress

[Current work items with progress indicators]

---

## 📋 Next Steps

[Prioritized list of next actions]

1. [First priority task]
2. [Second priority task]
3. [Third priority task]

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

[Any known bugs or limitations]

---

## 📝 Notes

[Additional context, decisions, or important information]
```

## Status Indicators

Use consistent status indicators:

- **✅ Complete** - Work is finished and tested
- **🟡 In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- **⚠️ Pending** - Planned but not started
- **🟢 Ready** - Ready for next phase
- **🔴 Blocked** - Blocked by dependencies or issues
- **❌ Cancelled** - Work that was planned but cancelled

## Update Process

When updating PROJECT_STATUS.md:

1. **Update the "Last Updated" date** at the top
2. **Refresh the overall status** percentage and brief description
3. **Move completed items** from "In Progress" to "Completed Components"
4. **Update progress percentages** for in-progress work
5. **Revise "Next Steps"** based on current priorities
6. **Add any new issues** to "Known Issues" section
7. **Document decisions** in "Notes" if significant

## AI Agent Responsibility

**AI agents working on projects MUST:**

1. **Check for PROJECT_STATUS.md** at the start of any work session
2. **Create it if missing** using the template above
3. **Update it after each significant change** or iteration
4. **Keep it accurate and current** - outdated status files are worse than no file
5. **Include specific details** - dates, commit references, or PR numbers when relevant

## Integration with Development Workflow

- **Before starting work**: Review PROJECT_STATUS.md to understand current state
- **During work**: Update status as progress is made
- **After completing work**: Update PROJECT_STATUS.md before committing
- **Before committing**: Ensure PROJECT_STATUS.md reflects all changes in the commit

## Example Update Pattern

```markdown
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-08  
**Overall Status**: 🟢 **95% Complete** - Icon Loading Issue Fixed

---

## ✅ Completed Components

### Icon Loading Fix (2026-01-08)
- ✅ Fixed icon path resolution in manifest.json
- ✅ Updated icon references in popup.html
- ✅ Verified icons load correctly in all contexts

---

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Manual testing of full extension functionality
2. User acceptance testing
3. Prepare for release
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include dates, commit hashes, or PR numbers when relevant
2. **Be Honest**: Don't inflate progress percentages
3. **Be Actionable**: Next steps should be clear and prioritized
4. **Be Concise**: Keep it readable, not exhaustive
5. **Be Current**: Update it regularly, not just at milestones

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Creating the file but never updating it
- ❌ Using vague status descriptions
- ❌ Forgetting to update the "Last Updated" date
- ❌ Leaving outdated information in the file
- ❌ Making it too verbose or too sparse

Remember: A well-maintained PROJECT_STATUS.md file is a sign of a well-managed project. Keep it current and useful.
