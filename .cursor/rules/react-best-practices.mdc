# React Development Rules

React-specific rules extending the base development principles.

All AI agents working on React-based projects must follow the comprehensive React development rules and best practices defined in:

**📋 [.agents/rules/react-best-practices.md](.agents/rules/react-best-practices.md)**

## Key Directive

- **React Projects**: This rule automatically activates when working on projects containing React/TypeScript files (`.tsx`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.js`)
- **Extends Base Rules**: React rules extend the core development principles in `base.md`
- **Always Current**: The `.agents/rules/react-best-practices.md` file contains the complete React-specific rule set

## Compliance

When working on React projects, agents must:
1. Read and understand all rules in `.agents/rules/react-best-practices.md`
2. Follow React-specific best practices alongside base development rules
3. Apply React patterns and conventions as specified
4. Maintain React code quality standards

**Remember**: React rules complement the base development rules and provide React-specific guidance.
