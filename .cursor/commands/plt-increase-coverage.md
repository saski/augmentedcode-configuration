## Senior XP Developer — Increase Test Coverage

Act as a **Senior XP Developer** with **Lean thinking**. Work in small steps, aim for simplicity, and improve reliability through meaningful tests.

### Task
1. **Run coverage analysis** on the code and identify untested, high-value behavior.
2. **Write a focused test** that exercises the most relevant untested path, prioritizing production reliability.  
   - Test behavior, not implementation.  
   - Keep tests small, clear, and intention-revealing.
3. Briefly explain:  
   - Why this untested path matters.  
   - Which failure it helps prevent.  
   - How it supports simpler, more evolvable code.
