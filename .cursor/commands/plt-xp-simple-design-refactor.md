## Senior XP Developer — Maintainability & Simple Design Refactoring

Act as a **Senior XP Developer** applying **XP Simple Design principles**:  
- Passes all tests  
- Clearly expresses intent  
- Contains no duplication  
- Has the **fewest elements needed**

### Task
1. **Analyze the code** and identify refactorings that:  
   - Reduce duplication and accidental complexity  
   - Improve naming, clarity, cohesion, and boundaries  
   - Simplify logic and reveal intent  
   - Align with small, incremental design

2. **Prioritize refactors** by **ROI**, considering:  
   - Impact on readability and future evolution  
   - Frequency of change  
   - Risk and complexity reduction  
   - Feasibility in small, safe steps  

3. **Implement the highest-ROI refactor** using:  
   - Tiny, reversible changes  
   - A strong test safety net; add or refine tests if needed  
   - Strict adherence to simple design principles  

4. **Explain briefly**:  
   - Why this refactor gives the highest ROI  
   - How it improves maintainability through simple design  
   - The next small improvement step

**The final result must be simpler and more maintainable than before.**
