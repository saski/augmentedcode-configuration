## Migration Baseline

- Recorded: 2026-08-17
- Accepted source revision:
  `e21a933cb2cd87298939b5a4c475edf48d7b0c78`
- Local `main` and `origin/main` match at the accepted revision.
- Legacy remote:
  `git@github.com-saski:saski/augmentedcode-configuration.git`
- Planned canonical remote: `git@github.com-saski:saski/arnesto.git`
- Rollback before legacy archival: restore the legacy URL as `origin` and
  verify `main` against the accepted revision.
- Rollback after legacy archival: unarchive the legacy repository, restore its
  URL as `origin`, and verify the accepted revision.

## Observable GitHub State

- Repository is public and GitHub reports `fork: true`.
- Parent and source are `eferro/augmentedcode-configuration`.
- Default branch is `main`.
- Repository size reported by the public API is approximately 1.9 MB.
- Public API reported fourteen stars, zero open issues, issues disabled, wiki
  enabled, and one child fork: `joseandrestrujillo/augmentedcode-configuration`.
- No public repository rulesets were returned on 2026-08-17.
- The public branch-details request returned HTTP 504, so branch protection
  remains unverified until authenticated GitHub access or the Settings UI is
  available.
- The repository contains one GitHub Actions workflow,
  `.github/workflows/check.yml`, which runs `make ci-check`.
- GitHub-hosted secrets, variables, environments, webhooks, Actions
  permissions, and other private settings are not observable through the
  current unauthenticated API session and must be checked before cutover.

## Active Local Consumers

- Twenty-six live home-directory symlinks resolve through the legacy checkout
  path when root instruction links are included.
- `~/.agents` is the stable shared entry point and currently resolves to the
  repository's `.agents` directory.
- Active external path or identity consumers exist in:
  - Codex trusted-project configuration;
  - MyBroworld agent guidance and chat-memory protocol;
  - net-art-studies agent guidance;
  - personal-knowledge-vault guidance and adapter documentation;
  - Hermes routing documentation and skills;
  - the shell-level Hermes skill-router comment.
- Eight tracked files outside historical `thoughts/` records contain the
  legacy repository identity. Historical research is excluded from mechanical
  replacement.

## Gate Evidence

- `49a2128 Prefer bounded lower-cost delegation` was committed separately.
- `e21a933 Add guarded Hermes source updates` was committed separately.
- The Hermes focused tests and the repository's canonical `make check` passed
  before both commits were pushed to the legacy `origin/main`.
- A behavior-level contract failed while setup still assumed the legacy checkout
  path and passed after `REPO_DIR` defaulted to the script directory.
- The focused portability contract, `openspec validate graduate-to-arnesto`,
  and the complete `make check` suite passed with the portable setup included.
