# OpenCode Free-Agent Entry

OpenCode supports two explicit execution modes. It does not decide between
them, and neither mode uses automatic model fallback.

## Frontier work

Sensitive, ambiguous, or multi-step work stays in Codex App or Codex CLI.
Those frontier sessions use Codex directly and do not pass through OmniRoute.
The frontier principal owns planning, OpenSpec, delegation, review, and
integration.

## Bounded free work

Use the free route only for an explicitly authorized, non-sensitive bounded
task. Copy the provider and worker policy from
[`templates/opencode/free-worker.jsonc`](../templates/opencode/free-worker.jsonc).
The only admitted models are:

- `omniroute/oc/deepseek-v4-flash-free`
- `omniroute/oc/big-pickle`

## Managed local installation

Install only the managed OpenCode fields with:

```bash
./setup-symlinks.sh opencode-free-worker
./setup-symlinks.sh validate-opencode-free-worker
```

The installer updates `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` atomically. It adds
the two verified model identifiers and the constrained `free-worker` agent if
they are missing. It preserves unrelated top-level configuration, providers,
models, agent definitions, and the existing local OmniRoute endpoint when it
uses either supported loopback form (`localhost` or `127.0.0.1`). It never
reads or writes OpenCode credential storage.

The local configuration must be strict JSON. A comment-bearing or malformed
JSONC file, a different OmniRoute endpoint, or an incompatible managed agent
is a visible conflict and leaves the file unchanged.

Dispatch the work through a versioned contract, then return the result to the
frontier principal for diff and validation review:

```json
{
  "contract_version": "1",
  "mode": "free",
  "execution_role": "worker",
  "parent_role": "frontier",
  "parent_run_id": "run-example",
  "delegation_depth": 1,
  "task_id": "task-example",
  "task_class": "bounded_code",
  "sensitivity": "non_sensitive",
  "working_directory": "/absolute/path/to/clean-worktree",
  "requirement": "Implement one precise, bounded change.",
  "allowed_files": ["relative/path/to/file"],
  "validation": { "command": ["bash", "tests/example-test.sh"] },
  "model": "omniroute/oc/deepseek-v4-flash-free",
  "timeout_seconds": 180
}
```

Run it with:

```bash
.agents/skills/free-agent-execution/scripts/run-free-worker /absolute/path/to/contract.json
```

## Hard prohibitions

The free route must not receive credentials, secrets, environment values,
personal data, or other sensitive content. It must not use `auto/*`, paid
models, shell access, recursive delegation, or automatic fallback.

## Recovery

If the selected free route is unavailable or semantically unhealthy, surface
the failure and do not retry on a paid model. Continue through direct Codex
frontier work only when that is an explicit decision; otherwise stop and report
the blocker.
