# Hermes, OmniRoute, and Telegram Operations

**Verified locally:** 2026-08-11

This runbook records the intended secret-free routing policy. The reusable
overlay is versioned at
[`templates/hermes/dynamic-routing.overlay.yaml`](../templates/hermes/dynamic-routing.overlay.yaml).
Credentials, OAuth state, Telegram identifiers, sessions, and paired-channel
state remain local machine data and are never committed.

## Operating model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    user["User"] --> telegram["Telegram"]
    telegram --> gateway["Hermes gateway"]
    gateway --> profile["Default profile"]
    profile --> input{"Image attached?"}

    input -->|No| free["Main agent\noc/deepseek-v4-flash-free"]
    input -->|Yes| vision["Auxiliary vision\ngpt-5.6-sol, low effort"]
    vision --> summary["Text image analysis"]
    summary --> free

    free --> omniroute["OmniRoute\nlocalhost:20128/v1"]
    vision --> codex["Codex app-server\nChatGPT OAuth"]
```

The normal Telegram path is free. An image triggers exactly one frontier
preprocessing call; Hermes converts its visual analysis to text and sends that
text to the free main model. The Telegram toolset intentionally omits the
explicit `vision` tool because automatic image preprocessing already handles
the attachment and a second tool call would duplicate frontier consumption.

## Model lanes

| Lane | Use for | Provider and model | Selection |
|---|---|---|---|
| Default text | Ordinary chat and bounded, non-sensitive work | `omniroute` / `oc/deepseek-v4-flash-free` | Automatic after `/new` |
| Automatic image analysis | Inspecting an attached image before free reasoning | `openai-codex` / `gpt-5.6-sol`, low effort | Automatic only when an image is present |
| Full frontier | Planning, SDD, orchestration, sensitive or ambiguous work | `openai-codex` / `gpt-5.6-sol` | Explicit model switch or dedicated profile |

`/new` clears session overrides and starts the default free model. `/status`
continues to report the free main model after an image turn; auxiliary vision
is a preprocessing call, not the session model.

Do not promote broad `auto/*`, `free-stack`, or `free-deterministic` aliases as
the operational default without a fresh semantic conformance test. A catalog
entry or HTTP 200 response is insufficient; the route must return usable
content for the requested task.

## Managed routing overlay

The repository overlay captures only portable policy. It is deliberately not
a complete Hermes configuration and MUST be merged into `~/.hermes/config.yaml`
rather than copied over it.

Before using it on another machine:

1. Replace `REPLACE_WITH_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` locally with the allowed Telegram
   chat identifier.
2. Keep `OMNIROUTE_API_KEY`, the Telegram bot token, and Codex OAuth state in
   the local profile environment or authentication stores.
3. Preserve unrelated local platform, memory, terminal, and sandbox settings.
4. Restart the launchd-supervised gateway and run the text and image smokes
   below.

The relevant machine-state boundary is:

| Purpose | Local path |
|---|---|
| Default ingress profile | `~/.hermes/config.yaml` and `~/.hermes/.env` |
| Optional named profiles | `~/.hermes/profiles/<profile>/config.yaml` and `.env` |
| Codex OAuth state | Hermes/Codex authentication stores |
| Mutable Hermes implementation | `~/.hermes/hermes-agent/` |

Never commit phone numbers, chat identifiers, bot tokens, provider keys,
session databases, paired-channel files, or OAuth credentials.

## Telegram procedure

Send every command as a separate Telegram message and wait for its reply. Do
not paste `/new` and `/model` into one message: Hermes treats text following
`/new` as a session title.

### Default free session

```text
/new
```

Expected result: `oc/deepseek-v4-flash-free` through the OmniRoute provider.
A minimal smoke prompt is:

```text
Reply with exactly: RUTA_FREE_OK
```

### Explicit full-frontier session

```text
/model gpt-5.6-sol --provider openai-codex
```

Use this for work that requires frontier planning or orchestration. The model
override is session-only unless `--global` is supplied; avoid `--global` when
the desired default remains free.

Return to the free main model with:

```text
/model oc/deepseek-v4-flash-free --provider custom
```

## Multiplex secret scope

In a multiplexed gateway, `get_secret()` deliberately fails outside a profile
scope. A failure such as:

```text
get_secret('OMNIROUTE_API_KEY') called with no profile secret scope active
```

means provider resolution escaped the routed profile's runtime scope. The
current local Hermes implementation wraps the `/model` handler in the routed
profile scope. Re-check this behavior after any Hermes source upgrade until
the fix is supplied by an upstream release.

## Health and recovery

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    symptom["Observed symptom"] --> kind{"Failure type"}
    kind -->|Telegram disconnected| restart["Restart launchd gateway"]
    kind -->|Dashboard unavailable| dashboard["Start hermes dashboard --no-open"]
    kind -->|OmniRoute credential scope| scope["Verify profile route and scoped /model handler"]
    kind -->|Image analysis fails| oauth["Refresh Codex OAuth in the default profile"]
    kind -->|Empty or paid free route| pin["Return to verified explicit free pin"]

    restart --> launchd["launchctl print gui/UID/ai.hermes.gateway"]
    dashboard --> browser["Open 127.0.0.1:9119"]
    scope --> restart
    oauth --> smoke["Run one-image smoke"]
    pin --> textSmoke["Run RUTA_FREE_OK smoke"]
```

Useful local checks:

```bash
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/ai.hermes.gateway"
hermes gateway list
hermes dashboard --status
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:20128/v1/models
```

`hermes gateway status` may lag behind launchd state; `launchctl print` is the
authoritative local process check. After a configuration change, restart the
supervised process rather than leaving a detached gateway with stale
environment values.

### Automatic reload after Desktop changes

Hermes Desktop and the Telegram gateway share the same `HERMES_HOME`, but they
are different processes. Desktop starts a local `hermes serve` backend; the
launchd job `ai.hermes.gateway` owns Telegram polling. An old interactive
`hermes` CLI session is a third process: it may keep a terminal and the state
database open, but it neither listens for Telegram nor competes with the
gateway. Exit it normally when it is no longer needed; closing it is not a
gateway recovery step.

Install the repository-owned launchd watcher once:

```bash
make install-hermes-gateway-config-watch
```

The watcher observes the global `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, `~/.hermes/.env`, and
`~/.hermes/auth.json`. A meaningful change made from Desktop to the global
model, provider, OAuth identity, or channel configuration automatically runs:

```bash
launchctl kickstart -k "gui/$(id -u)/ai.hermes.gateway"
```

Automatic OAuth token renewal does not restart the gateway. Tokens, expiry
timestamps, provider health, and request counters are deliberately excluded
from the semantic OAuth fingerprint so a background refresh cannot interrupt
an active Telegram task. Provider selection, provider membership, credential
identity, account identity, endpoint, authentication type, or priority changes
do trigger a restart. No credential value is logged or committed.

Check the watcher and its restart log with:

```bash
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/ai.hermes.gateway-config-watch"
tail -n 20 ~/.hermes/logs/gateway-config-watch.log
```

The watcher covers the global Desktop environment only. Named profiles under
`~/.hermes/profiles/` remain explicit operational units because observing an
entire mutable profile directory would also react to sessions, logs, and token
traffic and could create restart loops.

If Codex OAuth has expired, authenticate or run one direct Codex-backed Hermes
turn in the default profile before retrying image preprocessing. Keep this
recovery local; no OAuth artifact belongs in Git.

WhatsApp is optional and independent of Telegram. Keep
`WHATSAPP_ENABLED=false` in every active profile when it is unused, restart the
gateway, and confirm that no WhatsApp adapter is listed.

## Verification record

- The Telegram route selects the `default` profile.
- A text-only turn uses `oc/deepseek-v4-flash-free` through OmniRoute.
- A one-image smoke produced one auxiliary `gpt-5.6-sol` analysis followed by
  one free DeepSeek completion; the free main call used 2,477 input and 44
  output tokens.
- The launchd gateway was running and Telegram reconnected in polling mode.
- The committed regression test checks the free default, automatic low-effort
  frontier vision, default profile route, absence of the duplicate `vision`
  tool, and absence of common credential or personal-identifier patterns.
- OpenCode free workers remain a separate, bounded adapter path; this Hermes
  overlay does not make arbitrary OpenCode models trusted workers.
