# Skill Domain Routing Guide

Use this guide when the user describes a domain or problem shape and you need a fast shortlist of likely skills. The source tables in [skill-factory-skills.md](skill-factory-skills.md) remain the canonical inventory.

Each section gives primary tags, when the domain is useful, and the skills to consider first. A skill may still be useful outside its primary domain when its trigger text matches the task.
