# AI Feedback and Rule Refinement Cycle

## 1. Introduction / Problem

**Problem:** The AI's understanding of project-specific nuances, conventions, and user preferences can benefit from explicit feedback. Without a systematic process, valuable insights from user interactions might not be captured and integrated into the AI's guiding principles (i.e., the Development Rules in `.agents/rules/base.md`).

**Purpose:** This rule establishes a mandatory process for the AI to:
*   Actively learn from user feedback, guidance, and suggestions.
*   Proactively identify opportunities to enhance existing Development Rules based on these learnings.
*   Ensure that the AI's assistance remains aligned with evolving project needs and user expectations.
*   Maximize the value of user feedback by incorporating it into the AI's operational framework.

**When Relevant:** This rule is applicable after any interaction where the user provides explicit or implicit feedback, suggestions, corrections, new information, or expresses preferences. **The AI MUST actively analyze all user interactions for such learning opportunities, not only passively waiting for direct feedback, to proactively refine its understanding and the project's best practices.**

## 2. Implementation Steps: The Feedback Loop

Upon receiving feedback or guidance from the user, the AI MUST follow these steps:

1.  **Acknowledge and Internalize Feedback:**
    *   Carefully review and understand the user's input, whether it's a direct correction, a suggestion, or an observation about the AI's performance or output.

2.  **Analyze for Actionable Learnings:**
    *   Reflect on the interaction. What specific insights, patterns, preferences, or knowledge gaps were revealed?
    *   Consider:
        *   Was there a misunderstanding of a previous instruction or an existing rule?
        *   Does the user's input highlight a new best practice, convention, or piece of project knowledge?
        *   Is there an opportunity to clarify or improve an existing rule to prevent similar misunderstandings in the future?
        *   Could an existing rule be made more specific or comprehensive based on this new information?
        *   **Did the interaction involve modifying a document, and if so, was relevant metadata (e.g., `last_updated` date, `version` number, changelogs) also considered for updates according to established documentation standards?**

3.  **Review Existing Development Rules for Relevance:**
    *   Review the contents of `.agents/rules/base.md` and other relevant rule files in `.agents/rules/`.
    *   Identify if any existing rule(s) are directly or indirectly related to the feedback received and the learnings derived.
    *   Determine if an update to one or more rules could codify the new learning, making future AI assistance more accurate or helpful.

4.  **Formulate and Propose Rule Update(s) (If Applicable):**
    *   If a relevant rule can be improved or a new clarification is needed:
        *   **Clearly state to the user which rule(s) you propose to update.**
        *   **Quote the specific section(s) or line(s) of the rule that would be affected.**
        *   **Present the exact proposed change (e.g., new wording, additions, deletions).** Use a diff format if it aids clarity for substantial changes.
        *   **Explain *why* this change is being proposed and how it incorporates the learning from the user's recent feedback. Crucially, explicitly link the proposal back to the specific user feedback or interaction that prompted this learning. **Furthermore, briefly state how this proposed rule refinement is expected to improve future AI performance (e.g., enhancing accuracy, ensuring greater consistency with project goals, improving adherence to specific quality standards).** For example: "Based on your feedback on [date/time] regarding [briefly describe the feedback, e.g., 'the need for stricter TDD enforcement'], I've identified an opportunity to improve `base.md` section [X]. This change should help the AI consistently apply correct TDD practices in future development."
        *   **Consider Rule-Set Cohesion:** Before proposing the specific change, briefly consider if this update might necessitate minor harmonizing adjustments in other *directly and obviously related non-foundational rules* to maintain overall clarity and consistency within the rule-set. If such minor correlative adjustments are immediately apparent and simple, they MAY be bundled into the proposal, clearly distinguishing them from the primary change driven by user feedback. This is not a call for an exhaustive review but a check for immediate, obvious ripple effects.
        *   **Perform and Present Preliminary Impact Assessment (for Foundational Rules):** If the rule being proposed for modification is considered "foundational" (e.g., `base.md` or other core development rules), the AI **MUST** also:
            1.  Briefly analyze and state potential direct impacts or necessary correlative adjustments in other *known, directly related* rules or core project documents (like `README.md`).
            2.  Present this as a concise impact summary. For example: "If this change to `base.md` section [X] is approved, it might necessitate adjustments in section [Y] to maintain consistency regarding [specific concept], and we should also review `README.md`'s section on [related topic] to ensure continued alignment. This proposal appears consistent with the overall project goals."
            3.  This assessment is preliminary and aims to highlight immediate, obvious dependencies, not to conduct an exhaustive system-wide audit with each proposal.
        *   **Explicitly state: "I will await your review and approval before making any changes to the rule(s).**"

5.  **Await Explicit User Approval:**
    *   **DO NOT** modify any rule file(s) until the user explicitly reviews the proposal and gives clear approval to proceed with the specific changes.

6.  **Apply Approved Changes and Confirm:**
    *   If the user approves the proposed update(s), use the appropriate tool to edit the target rule file(s) precisely as agreed.
    *   After the update is applied, confirm to the user: "The [Rule Name].md has been updated as per your approval."

## 3. Real-World Example

*   **Scenario:** The user and AI collaboratively worked on improving test coverage. During this process, the user provided feedback that the AI should always run tests automatically after every code change, without asking for permission.
*   **Feedback Loop in Action:**
    1.  **Learning:** The AI learned that automatic test execution is a key expectation and should be explicitly stated in the development rules.
    2.  **Rule Review:** The AI identified that `base.md` section 10 (Test-Driven Development Rules) was relevant.
    3.  **Proposal:** The AI proposed to the user: "Based on our work on test execution, I've learned that automatic test running should be mandatory. I suggest we update `base.md` section 10 to explicitly state that tests should run automatically after every change without asking permission. [Details of proposed changes followed]. I will await your review and approval."
    4.  **Approval:** The user reviewed and approved the changes.
    5.  **Update:** The AI updated `base.md` section 10 accordingly.

## 4. Common Pitfalls / Anti-Patterns (To Be Avoided by the AI)

*   **Implicit Application:** Modifying rules without explicit user review and approval of the proposed changes.
*   **Failure to Explain:** Proposing a rule change without clearly linking it back to the specific user feedback or the learning derived from the interaction.
*   **Vague Proposals:** Not specifying which rule or which exact parts of a rule are suggested for modification, making it difficult for the user to review.
*   **Ignoring Feedback:** Failing to initiate this learning and review cycle when relevant feedback is provided.
*   **Over-Correction:** Attempting to update multiple unrelated rules or making changes that go beyond the scope of the recent feedback.
*   **Proactive Modification Without Trigger:** Changing rules without it being a direct outcome of a feedback-driven learning opportunity. This rule is about reactive improvement based on interaction.
*   **Not Confirming Update:** Forgetting to inform the user after an approved rule modification has been successfully applied.

- The AI should proactively suggest improvements to documentation structure and workflow clarity when user feedback indicates confusion or friction.
