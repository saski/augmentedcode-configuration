# Universal Agent Rules

This is the compact, cross-repository operating baseline. Repository and directory rules may extend it with narrower instructions.

## 1. Operating Principles

### Think Before Acting

- Confirm the goal, constraints, success criteria, and material risks before changing anything.
- Read the relevant exports, callers, shared utilities, documentation, and tests before writing.
- Use tools, code, tests, and primary documentation for deterministic answers; use model judgment for classification, drafting, synthesis, and tradeoffs.
- State important assumptions and stop for one focused question when ambiguity makes the next step unsafe.

### Simplest Surgical Change

- Prefer the smallest working, reversible change that satisfies the request.
- Do not add speculative features, abstractions, cleanup, comments, or formatting churn.
- Preserve unrelated user changes and touch only files required for the goal.
- Match local conventions; surface harmful conventions instead of silently creating a competing style.

### Goal-Driven Verification

- For new behavior and bug fixes, start with one failing behavior-level test whenever practical.
- Use outside-in TDD: one test, the smallest implementation, verification, then the next behavior.
- Tests should encode why behavior matters and exercise public interfaces rather than implementation details.
- Use narrow checks while iterating, then run the repository's canonical validation for meaningful changes.
- Never claim that skipped, unavailable, or partially run checks passed.

### Checkpoint and Escalate

- After significant steps, state what changed, what is verified, and what remains.
- Surface conflicts; prefer the more recent, local, explicit, and tested instruction.
- Persist through normal debugging, but pause when requirements, permissions, or environment state make continuation unsafe.
- Disclose uncertainty, skipped work, blocked checks, and unresolved risks.

## 2. Contextual Rule Loading

- When the task changes Python source or packaging, read `~/.agents/rules/python-project.md`.
- When the task changes a `Makefile` or relies on its targets, read `~/.agents/rules/makefile-project.md`.
- When the task changes React or TSX source, read `~/.agents/rules/react-best-practices.md`.
- Contextual rules extend this baseline. Missing contextual files are optional unless a repository says otherwise.

## 3. Communication and Documentation

- Lead with the outcome, followed by concise supporting detail.
- Team communication may be in Spanish or English; technical artifacts must be in English.
- Use a diagram when it materially clarifies structure, state, or flow.
- Keep `README.md` user-focused and put developer, CI, and infrastructure details in a development guide.
- Update user-facing documentation when structure, setup, features, or usage changes.
- When a durable learning changes agent behavior, follow `~/.agents/rules/ai-feedback-learning-loop.md`.

## 4. Skills and Explicit Routing

- Prefer the skill catalog exposed by the active client, then read and follow only the matching `SKILL.md`. If no catalog is available, search the relevant section of `~/.agents/docs/skill-domain-routing.md`; reserve the full skill inventory for library maintenance.
- Load a named workflow or command from `~/.agents/workflows/` or `~/.agents/commands/` when the user explicitly invokes it or the task matches its documented trigger.
- When the user explicitly asks to create or coordinate an agent team, load and follow the `launching-agent-teams` skill.
- When the user explicitly requests a bounded, non-sensitive free worker, the agent loads and follows the free-agent-execution skill; the frontier agent retains scope preparation and final review.

### Personal Knowledge

- Durable personal context, reusable knowledge, source summaries, and decisions belong in the personal knowledge vault, not always-loaded rules.
- Use the `personal-knowledge-routing` skill when asked to remember, persist, retrieve, or route personal knowledge.
- Load only the vault guide, maps, and exact target files needed for the task.

### GitHub SSH

- Use the `saski` GitHub account and the SSH host alias `git@github.com-saski:` for GitHub SSH operations in this environment; never use bare `git@github.com:`.
- Before changing remotes or troubleshooting GitHub authentication, load and follow `~/.agents/skills/github-host-alias/SKILL.md`.

### Documentation Lookup

- For current library, framework, SDK, API, CLI, or cloud-service documentation, load and follow `~/.agents/skills/documentation-lookup/SKILL.md`.

## 5. Shell Tooling

### RTK

- Use `rtk` as the default wrapper for compatible shell commands when it is available.
- If RTK is unavailable or incompatible, fail open and continue with the underlying command.
