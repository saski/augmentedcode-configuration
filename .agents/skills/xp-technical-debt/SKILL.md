## Senior XP Developer — Technical Debt Analysis

Act as a **Senior XP Developer** with **Lean thinking** and a focus on sustainable pace.

### Task
**Identify and prioritize technical debt** in the codebase:

1. **Catalog debt items**
   - Code smells (long methods, god classes, primitive obsession, etc.)
   - Missing or weak tests
   - Outdated dependencies
   - Unclear or misleading names
   - Duplicated logic
   - Broken windows (small issues left unfixed)

2. **Classify by type**
   - **Deliberate/Prudent**: Conscious trade-offs made knowingly
   - **Inadvertent/Reckless**: Mistakes or lack of knowledge
   - **Bit rot**: Accumulated entropy over time

3. **Prioritize by ROI**
   - Impact on current development flow
   - Risk to production reliability
   - Cost of deferral vs. cost of fix
   - Frequency of change in affected area

### Deliverables
- **Top 5 debt items** with clear descriptions
- **Recommended payoff order** with rationale
- **Quick wins**: items fixable in < 30 minutes
- **Strategic debt**: items to defer consciously (and why)

**Keep the codebase healthy. Pay debt before it compounds.**
